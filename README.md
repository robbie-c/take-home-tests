# Take Home Tests

One place to put many of the take-home tests I've done. Obviously the only ones here are when the company has asked me to put them somewhere publicly visible, usually specifically GitHub.

If you're considering whether to hire me, please look through these. It's more information for you, and if you decide that you don't need to give me your own test then that's time saved for me.
