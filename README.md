# Take Home Tests

One place to put many of the take-home tests I've done. Obviously the only ones here are when the company has asked me to put them somewhere publicly visible, usually specifically GitHub.

If you're considering whether to hire me, please look through these. It's more information for you without me having to do anything at all, win-win!
